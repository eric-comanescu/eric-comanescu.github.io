			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Currently I'm a third year CompSci student at John Abbot College.
			</p>
			<p>
				I generally lean towards anything related to backend developpment,
				as well as game developpment, which is what inspired me to go into
				this field.
			</p>
			<p>
				Outside of school, I enjoy learning new skills that I can add to my
				repertoire. I've been teaching myself C++ for the past year and have
				reached a point where I'm comfortable enough with it to use it for
				one of my classes' final project.
